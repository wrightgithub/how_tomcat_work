This is a source release of the mod_jk 1.2 web server connector for
Tomcat. Only the web server connector source is included.  The Tomcat
side of the connector is available with the normal Tomcat distribution.

Documentation for how to build mod_jk 1.2 from source and configure
it for your webserver is located in the native/BUILDING.txt file in this
source distribution.

For the impatient Apache admins:
$> cd native
$> ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs (or where ever the apxs/apxs2 is)
$> make
$> su -c 'make install'

For the impatient SunONE admins:
$> cd native
$> ./configure --enable-netscape
$> cd netscape
$> make -f Makefile.solaris
