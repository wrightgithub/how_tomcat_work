      will give 50-50% load.
    * Use of shm for load balancer via JkShmFile. Be sure to define JkShmFile /path/to/smfile 
      in your httpd.conf
    * on Series you should use the latest PTF for Apache 2.0 (which is now 2.0.52) and ad minima
      SI17402/SI17061 or cumulative including them.
     
Changes in JK 1.2.8

    * Update to Apache License 2.0 [hgomez]
    * For Apache 2.0, when the env var no-jk is present, mod_jk didn't handle request (declined)
      and as such dont forward requests to tomcats even if URL match.
      To be used with SetEnvIf or BrowserMatch directives for example to exclude some URL/URI or
      Browser [hgomez].
    * Add a fix for iSeries (AS/400) which use XOPEN/Unix98 APIs and need sa_len to be set when

Changes with JK 1.2.5
    * Fix a thread safe bug when mapping URI's.
      [billbarker]
    * Fix a thread safe bug when resolving worker host name
      when using mod_jk with Apache 2 and the worker MPM.
      [hgomez]
    * Remove an unnecessary error message when connections to
      all load balanced workers fail.
      [glenn]
    * When mod_jk cannot connect to a worker include the name of
      the worker in the error message.  This is especially helpful
      when you are using load balanced workers.
      [glenn]
    * Fix problem with mod_jk.log getting opened multiple times for
      Apache 2. Only one mod_jk.log can be configured.

      versions of Apache 2.
      [jfclere]
    * Use reentrant version of strtok() for web server's which use
      threads. This fixes a thread safe bug under Apache 2 and the
      worker MPM.
      [glenn]
    * Fix the Apache 2 mod_jk hook priority so that mod_jk works
      well with both mod_alias and mod_dir.
      [glenn]

Changes with JK 1.2.3:
    * Add the ability to configure JkLog to pipe its log output to an
      executable such as Apache rotatelogs or cronolog.  Apache 2.0 only.
      [glenn]
    * Add JkAutoAlias to Apache 2.0
      [glenn]
    * Apache 2/1.3, if Tomcat returns an error but not content,
      let Apache handle processing the error returned by Tomcat.
    * Added the load balancer sticky_session property. If set to 0
      requests with servlet SESSION ID's can be routed to any Tomcat
      worker. Default is 1, sessions are sticky.
      [glenn]
    * Cleaned up detection and reporting of aborted client connections.
      This cleanup also makes sure that mod_jk does not pass any requests
      on to Tomcat if the remote client aborted its connection.
      [glenn]
    * Fixed a bug in Apache 2.0 which caused a POST request forwarded to
      Tomcat to fail if it generated SSI directives which were post
      processed by mod_include.
      [glenn]
    * Fixed a bug in JkRequestLogFormat when printing the request URI that

      aborted requests

      making it ready to works with mod_deflate and AddOutputFilterByType 
      [hgomez]
    * jk will check result of get_endpoint and handle a failure.
      This call can fail if the allocation for the endpoint fails because of low memory conditions 
      causing a dereference of NULL when we try and access the endpoint
      [mmanders]
      
Changes with JK 1.2.1:
    * Don't send initial chunk for chunked encoding, fix #14282
