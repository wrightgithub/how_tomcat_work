  Building from the subversion tree: (for developers only).
  -----------------------------------
  When using a subversion tree buildconf.sh must be run before configure.
  The today version of buildconf.sh build the following files:
  libtool files in scripts/build/unix (should copy them?).
  Makefile.in from Makefile.am
  aclocal.m4 from different m4 files located in the local machine.
  configure from configure.in and aclocal.m4.
  If you see error message from automake, don't care about them.


  Building using configure
  ------------------------
 
  It is possible to use autoconf for configuration and installation.
  To create tomcat-connectors's autoconf script, you will need libtool
  1.5.2, automake 1.10 and autoconf 2.59 or newer. The use of more recent
  versions is encouraged, e.g. for reliable detection of the features of
  recent version of operating systems.

  Those tools will not be required if you are just
  using a package downloaded from apache.org, they are only required for
  developers.
 
  To configure tomcat-connectors run the following commands.
 
  ./buildconf.sh  (not required unless you are a developer)
  ./configure [autoconf arguments] [tomcat-connectors arguments]
  make

  It is possible to set CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to add some platform specifics:
  LDFLAGS=-lc \
  ./configure -with-apxs=/home2/local/apache/bin/apxs

  
  Build for both Apache 1.3 and 2.0
  ---------------------------------

  If you want to build mod_jk for Apache 1.3 and 2.0, you should :

  use configure and indicate Apache 1.3 apxs location (--with-apxs)
  use make
  copy the mod_jk binary to the apache modules location

  make clean (to remove all previously compiled modules)
  use configure and indicate Apache 2.0 apxs location,
  then make.

  ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs
  make
  cp ./apache-1.3/mod_jk.so /usr/lib/apache
  make clean
  ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs2
  make 
  cp ./apache-2.0/mod_jk.so /usr/lib/apache2
   

  Examples
  --------

  Apache2.0, JNI support:

  ./configure --with-apxs=/opt/apache2/bin/apxs --with-java-home=${JAVA_HOME} --with-java-platform=2 -enable-jni

  Apache 1.3, no JNI support:

  ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs 

  tomcat-connectors arguments
  -----------------------------------
  JVM related parameters:
  --with-java-home=DIR
  DIR is the  patch to the JDK root directory. Something like: /opt/java/jdk12
  --with-os-type[=SUBDIR] 
  SUBDIR is the os-type subdirectory, normaly configure should guess it
  correctly.
  --with-arch-type[=SUBDIR]
  SUBDIR is the arch subdirectory, normaly configure should guess it correctly. 
  --with-java-platform=VAL
  VAL is the Java platform 1 is 1.1.x and 2 is 1.2.x. It is guessed correctly.
  
  Apache related parameters:
  --with-apxs[=FILE]
  FILE is the location of the apxs tool. Default is finding apxs in PATH.
  It builds a shared Apache module. It detects automaticly the Apache version.
  (2.0 and 1.3)
* --with-apache=DIR
  DIR is the path where apache sources are located.
  The apache sources should have been configured before configuring mod_jk.
  DIR is something like: /home/apache/apache_1.3.19
  It builds a static Apache module.
  --enable-EAPI
  This parameter is needed when using Apache-1.3 and mod_ssl, otherwise you
  will get the error message: "this module might crash under EAPI!" when
  loading libjk.so in httpd.

  JNI support:
  --enable-jni
  Build the jni_connect.so and the JNI worker.

* Static build need more tests, and we strongly recommand dynamic build
  using DSO/APXS.


  Installation
  ------------

  The mod_jk binary will be in :

  ./apache-1.3/mod_jk.so if you select to build mod_jk for apache 1.3

  ./apache-2.0/mod_jk.so if you select to build mod_jk for apache 2.0



  Building for Netscape/iPlanet/SunONE WebServer
  ----------------------------------------------
  make clean (to remove all previously compiled modules)
  use configure and indicate that you will be building the
  netscape nsapi redirector, then make the redirector plugin:

  ./configure --enable-netscape
  cd netscape
  make -f Makefile.solaris

  This assumes that SUITSPOT_HOME is defined and points to
  your SunONE install path (eg: /opt/SUNWwbsvr/plugins)
  and that JAVA_HOME is defined (eg: /opt/SUNWwbsvr/bin/https/jdk).

  Misc notes 
  ----------

  HP-UX build notes :

  If you plan to use GCC on HP-UX to build mod_jk, be sure to 
  have -DHPUX11GCC defined (usually by setting CLAGS before configure)

  Reports are that the stripped down cc version that ships with
  HP-UX won't be able to works, you should habe the HP add-on ANSI C 
  Compiler package.

  A good repository for HP-UX gnu tools is :

  http://gatekeep.cs.utah.edu/


  Solaris build notes :

  the build should works with the GNU gcc compiler, on both
  SPARC and x86 architecture systems.

  A good repository for Solaris gnu tools is :

  http://www.sunfreeware.com/

  Be carefull when mixing native compiler and gnu compiler, and
  ensure that apache and mod_jk will be compiled and linked with
  the same tools (ie full Solaris or full GNU)
