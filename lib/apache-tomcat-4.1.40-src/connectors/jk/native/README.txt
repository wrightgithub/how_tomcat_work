README for tomcat-connector

$Id: README.txt 572120 2007-09-02 19:32:11Z markt $

Please see doc/mod_jk-howto.html for more verbose instructions

* What is tomcat-connector ?

tomcat-connector is a new project to release web-servers connector
for the Tomcat servlet engine.

This project didn't start from null since it reuse the latest code from
mod_jk for the native parts and tomcat 3.3 for the java side of the 
force.

From mod_jk we gain :

* A connector (plugin) for many Web Server, including
  Apache HTTP Server, Netscape/IPLanet NES and Microsoft IIS
  It also support JNI (and seems to used at least by IBM under 
  AS/400 for Apache/WebSphere connectivity).
  
* Fault-tolerance and load-balancing. mod_jk use the concept of 
  workers which handle a particular request, and a special worker
  , the lb worker, is a group (cluster ?) of physical workers.

* Direct access to Tomcat 3.2/3.3/4.0/4.1 servlet engine via ajp13
  protocol. 

* OK, then how do I build web-connector ? Just take a look at BUILDING.txt
