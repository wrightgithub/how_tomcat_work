<section name="Purpose">
<p>
Use mod_dav to modify JSP pages.
</p>
</section>

<section name="extract of httpd.conf">
<p>
The Alias is just for confort ;-)
<source>
  Alias /examples/jsp-source /home/jfclere/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.24/webapps/examples/jsp
  &lt;Location /examples/jsp-source&gt;
    Dav On
 
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName DAV
    AuthUserFile user.passwd
 
    &lt;LimitExcept GET OPTIONS&gt;
      require user admin
    &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;
  &lt;/Location&gt;

  &lt;LocationMatch "/*.jsp"&gt;
    JkUriSet worker ajp13:localhost:8009
  &lt;/LocationMatch&gt;

</source>
The LocationMatch only maps the *.jsp files.
To have also the images it is possible to the DefaultServlet by mapping /examples.
<source>
  &lt;Location /examples&gt;
    JkUriSet worker ajp13:localhost:8009
  &lt;/Location&gt;
</source>
Or to get the images served by httpd and not by Tomcat.
<source>
  Alias /examples/images /home/jfclere/jakarta-tomcat-4.1.24/webapps/examples/images
</source>
<source>
</source>
</p>
</section>
<section name="extract of workers2.properties">
<p>
The worker ajp13:localhost:8009 of the JkUriSet Directive has to be defined
in workers2.properties.
<source>
# Example socket channel, override port and host.
[channel.socket:localhost:8009]
port=8009
host=127.0.0.1
 
# define the worker
[ajp13:localhost:8009]
channel=channel.socket:localhost:8009
