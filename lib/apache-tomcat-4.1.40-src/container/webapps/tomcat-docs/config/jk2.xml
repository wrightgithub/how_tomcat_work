    <title>The JK 2 Connector</title>
  </properties>

<section name="Introduction">

  <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: The JK 2 connector is now deprecated. Use 
  <a href="jk.html">JK</a> or
  <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/mod/mod_proxy_ajp.html">
  mod_proxy_ajp</a> instead.</b></p>

  <p>The <strong>JK 2 Connector</strong> is a web server component used to
  invisibly integrate Tomcat
 with a web server such as Apache or IIS.
  Communication between the web server and Tomcat is via the <code>JK</code>
  protocol (also known as the <code>AJP</code> protocol).</p>

  <p>Tomact is usually integrated with a web server in cases where you want
  the web server to handle the static content contained in the web application,
  and/or utilize the web server's SSL processing.  In many application
  environments, this will result in better overall performance than running
  your applications under Tomcat stand-alone using the <a href="coyote.html">
  Coyote HTTP/1.1 Connector</a>. However, the only way to know for sure whether
  it will provide better performance for <strong>your</strong> application is
  to try it both ways.</p>
