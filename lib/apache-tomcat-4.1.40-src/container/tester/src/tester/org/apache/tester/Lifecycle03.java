 * Test for servlet lifecycle management.  It's behavior is controlled by

 * <ul>
 * <li><em>1</em> - Throw an <code>UnavailableException</code> that indicates
 *     permanent unavailablility, which should cause this servlet instance
 *     to be destroyed and thrown away.</li>
 * <li><em>2</em> - Check the lifecycle variables to ensure that the old
 *     instance was not reused.</li>
